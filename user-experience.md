An easy and effective way to style disabled buttons is to fade them back by 50%s `opacity: 0.5;` and cursor to `cursor: not-allowed;`.

Arrows are ambiguous visual markers for sorting order.  For example the up arrow is not consistently interpreted as descending order (Z to A). The visual pattern of a triangle is more clear. A triangle pointing down shows descending order with its bigger base at the top and smaller tip the bottom. A triangle pointing up shows ascending order.
