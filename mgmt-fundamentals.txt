Management Fundamentals
=======================

Plan to learn the fundamentals of management from Andrew Grove's book
"High Output Management" and reading several XP programming books.

Also want to expose myself to Will Larson's writings on engineering strategy
at lethain.com and Kent Beck's 3X strategy (Explore/Expand/Extract).

How do you learn the fundamentals? "The deliberate study of a specific body
of material so that it can be retrieved at will and used with skill."

#1: Be deliberate.

Keep in mind the difference between education and training according to
Richard Hamming: "Education is what, when, and why to do a thing. Training
is how to do it".

Once the fundamentals have been learned then you can develop a "style".
