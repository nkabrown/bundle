**parameter definition**

Sometimes beginners find it hard to give parameters informative names. They may give the parameter the name of the argument they are passing in. Or the name may be misleading because they haven't considered the type of value that they are passing into the function body. Two things to keep in mind as you define your functions; always know the type of value (string, number, function, etc) that your parameter will have, and name your parameters according to their usage within the function body, not according to outside factors.
