<ins>Chapter One</ins>

people generally underexposed to pure mathematics

def 1: a set is a collection of distinct objects, none of which is the set itself

def 2: a set containing no elements is called an empty set

def 3: set A is said to be a subset of set B (A ⊂ B) if every element of A is also an element of B

likewise every set is a subset of itself and an empty set is the subset of every set

def 4: set A is said to be equal to set B (A = B) if A ⊂ B and B ⊂ A

Theorem 1: There is only one empty set ({} or ∅)
