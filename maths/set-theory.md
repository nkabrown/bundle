# Naive Set Theory

*notes on _Naive Set Theory_ by Paul R. Halmos*

A set is a collection of objects. Those objects are called elements of the set. An element can be a set.

The principle concept of set theory is belonging represented with an epsilon: x ∈ A. Belonging is one possible relation between sets, but equality is an even more elementary relation between sets. Two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements. This is the axiom of extension and it is a logically necessary property of equality.

If every element that belongs to set A also belongs to set B then A is a subset of B. This is represented as A ⊂ B or B ⊃ A. Set inclusion is reflexive and transitive meaning A ⊂ A and if A ⊂ B and B ⊂ C then A ⊂ C. Equality is symmetric A = B and B = A, but set inclusion is antisymmetric. Belonging, unlike inclusion, is not reflexive or transitive.

The relationship of the axiom of extension to equality is very clear but what is its relationship to belonging and inclusion?

The axiom of extension explained with truth-functional logic:

Symbolic key:

A: x belongs to set X.
B: x belongs to set Y.

(A →  B) ∧ (B →  A)

Both if x belongs to set X then x belongs to set Y and if x belongs to set Y then x belongs to set X.

A ↔  B

x belongs to set X if and only if x belongs to set Y.

The axiom of extension is biconditional because it entails the conditional in both directions.
