## Share Locally Hosted Sites On The Network

You can easily share a site you are hosting on your local machine with someone on the same network.

Hold option + click on the wifi bars in the toolbar at the top of the screen. This will display your IP address on the network.

Your IP address and the port you are hosting on are all that is needed for someone on the same network to access your locally hosted site.

`<your IP address>:8888`
