Restructure learning notes respository
======================================
 
✓  Archive all older material in an archive/ directory 

Time to refresh and redirect the purpose of the bundle repository. I am going
to move away from grouping learnings by topic and move toward treating the 
repository as more of an engineering log.

To clear the slate for new materials and a different repo purpose and
structure all my old files need to be archived.

✓  Update the README

Describe the new purpose of the repository, which is, public accountability for
OKRs and engineering logs in the form of key learnings gained from putting a 
marginal improvement strategy to work.

README should display current quarters OKRs and possibly last quarters OKRs and grades.

Possibly leave some links to highlights from the archive. What in the archive do
I want to be easily discoverable? 

✓ Create a list of programming tasks

In order to effectively put a marginal improvement strategy to work I need to
gather a list of the programming tasks that I need to regularly engage in.
Brainstorm this list, clean it up, and then append new tasks as they arise.
