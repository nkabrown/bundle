# VIM

To search for a known file name in directory of folders use a wildcard `:e **/filename.txt`

`**` wildcard matches anything, including nothing, and **recurses** into directories. So you can call this anywhere in folder structure and it will search back up to the top-levels.

`$A` will append to the end of all selected lines when you are in visual block mode `<C-v>`

Convert Windows/DOS carriage return characters into newlines `:%s/^M/\r/g` â€” **this is great for formating csv files that were saved from Excel sheets**

Use alternative delimiter characters to make substitutions on dates using slashes `:%s#3/2/17#03/02/2017#g`

Toggle vim's boolean options with `!`: `:set list!` and reset an option to the default value with `&`: `:set list&`

Print the current file name `CTRL-G`
