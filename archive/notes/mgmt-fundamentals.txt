Management Fundamentals
=======================

Plan to learn the fundamentals of management from Andrew Grove's book
"High Output Management" (HOM) and reading several XP programming books.

Also want to expose myself to Will Larson's writings on engineering strategy
at lethain.com and Kent Beck's 3X strategy (Explore/Expand/Extract).

Find a rationale for everything you do.

How do you learn the fundamentals? "The deliberate study of a specific body
of material so that it can be retrieved at will and used with skill."

"How to be a great painter cannot be taught in words; on learns by trying many
different approaches that seem to surround the subject. Art teachers usually
let the advanced student paint, and then make suggestions on how they would
have done it, or what might also be tried, more or less as the points arise
in the student's head â€“ which is where the learning is supposed to occur!"
- Richard Hamming

#1: Be deliberate.

Keep in mind the difference between education and training according to
Richard Hamming: "Education is what, when, and why to do a thing. Training
is how to do it".

Once the fundamentals have been learned then you can develop a "style".

**Basics of Production**

Three requirements of good production systems: scheduled delivery time,
acceptable quality level, and lowest possible cost.

Lowest cost is an inequality.

Mental exercises:

- Are HOM's requirements of production true requirements? For example, if
  there is no scheduled delivery can that still be production?

- Metaphors of production to meditate upon: a "flow of activity" or a
  "sequence of steps" to produce a specific output.

- What is my team's production flow?

- How will agile effect our team's production flow?
