## Concepts

**Two Ways of Thinking** There are two distinctly different ways of thinking associated with two mutually exclusive
brain states.

*Focused Mode Thinking* is associated with highly attentive brain states and is intense concentration seeking thought
patterns to solve specific problems or understand concepts.

*Diffuse Mode Thinking* is associated with resting brain states and is unconcious scanning and processing seeking
to make connections between distant ideas and strengthening associations.
