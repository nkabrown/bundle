# Cognitive Education

a collection of concepts and strategies guided by cognitive psychology

## Concepts

**Two Ways of Thinking** There are two distinctly different ways of thinking associated with two mutually exclusive
brain states.

*Focused Mode Thinking* is associated with highly attentive brain states and is intense concentration seeking thought
patterns to solve specific problems or understand concepts.

*Diffuse Mode Thinking* is associated with resting brain states and is unconcious scanning and processing seeking
to make connections between distant ideas and strengthening associations.

Engagement of both modes of thinking is necessary to learning.

**Working Memory** has only 4 or so availble slots to hold information in your consciousness at any one time.
