# Naive Set Theory

*notes on _Naive Set Theory_ by Paul R. Halmos*

A set is a collection of objects. Those objects are called elements of the set. An element can be a set.

The principle concept of set theory is belonging represented with an epsilon: x âˆˆ A. Belonging is one possible relation between sets, but equality is an even more elementary relation between sets. Two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements. This is the axiom of extension and it is a logically necessary property of equality.
