# Bundle

This is a repurposed repository whose new aim is public accountability for Objectives & Key Results (OKRs) and engineering logs in the form of key learnings gained from putting a marginal improvement strategy to work. Old collected gists and thoughts can now be found in the `archive` directory.

"...if you take no action with the new ideas you have wasted your time." â€“ Donald Rienertsen

Understand and use software design principles

- applications built with deep modules and properly abstracted layers
- code and projects are properly documented

Deeply understand the programming languages I use

- Python documentation read and understood

## Last Quarter OKRs
