This is a repurposed repository whose new aim is public accountability for Objectives & Key Results (OKRs) and engineering logs in the form of key learnings gained from putting a marginal improvement strategy to work. Old collected gists and thoughts can now be found in the `archive` directory.

"...if you take no action with the new ideas you have wasted your time." – Donald Rienertsen

## Over-arching objectives

Gain proficiency in math and core computer systems topics

Mastery of the programming languages I use at work

## Current Quarter OKRs

Practice, teach and enforce work's coding standards

- familiarity with frontend and backend coding standards and supporting docs
- put into practice in regular code reviews

Deeply understand the programming languages I use

- Python documentation read and understood
- stretch JavaScript with Python knowledge
- ES6+ features understood and used

## Last Quarter OKRs

Implement marginal improvement strategy – 2

- create a list of all programming tasks
- 1% improvement for all programming tasks
- track and log marginal improvements

Understand and use software design principles – 3

- applications built with deep modules and properly abstracted layers
- code and projects are properly documented

Deeply understand the programming languages I use – 4

- Python documentation read and understood
