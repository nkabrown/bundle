**Boolean attributes**

Boolean attributes are attributes that when present on an HTML element are true and the absence of the attribute represents false. `<input type="text" disabled>` To set a boolean attribute using d3 use `d3.attr()`.

```
// setting a boolean attribute
d3.select(element).attr('disabled', '');

// removing a boolean attribute
d3.select(element).attr('disabled', null);
```

**Descriptive titles**

The HTML `title` attribute represents advisory information for the element when triggered by pointer-events. A title attribute can helpfully explain an axis label for example. A SVG title element can be appended to a SVG text element to display advisory information on pointer-events.

**Tooltips**

Padding, particularly outside padding, can greatly help the readability of information on a tooltip. Labels can be helpful and making them a light gray, perhaps `#a0a0a0`, keeps their presence subduded. Tooltips that are associated with any kind of significant area should be moveable. This can be accomplished with the `mousemove` event. The `mouseover` and `mouseout` events handle the opacity transitions for the tooltip while the `mousemove` event populates the tooltip html and updates the x and y coordinates.
